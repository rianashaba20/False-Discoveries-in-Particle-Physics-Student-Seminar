## Abstract
The seminar discusses the paper published in 1984 by UA1 experiment led by Carlo Rubbia, that reported candidate events for the initially-interpreted evidence for the top quark. The claimed discovery was later determined to be false, so the focus is on reviews regarding the historical and scientific context, the experimental methodologies and scientific education for modern particle physics.

## Paper by UA1 experiment
For this seminar a lot of references including papers, interviews etc. were used, but the main focus was to discuss the experimental approach and results that were included in the original paper published by UA1 experiment in 1984.
